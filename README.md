This Online Quiz API is a backend service built using Node.js and MongoDB for creating and managing quizzes. It supports different types of questions, including single choice, multiple choice, and text-based answers. The API allows users to create quizzes, add questions, submit answers, and receive scores in real-time. Data validation is handled by Joi to ensure only valid quizzes and questions are saved.
